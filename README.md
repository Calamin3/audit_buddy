Edited from Eddy's version. 

Included website scraping to scrape websites that is returned from Eddy's results. The website scraping tool does not work well if the result is a PDF document, but could possibly use the PDF read tool for it.
Returns more specific info and stats, but greatly uses more tokens.

# Noted Functions Missing

- Does not scrape websites with javascript
- Does not scrape PDF files onlnie
- Does not access given list of websites (Hansard, HWZ, etc)
- Need to provide the output in a structured format
